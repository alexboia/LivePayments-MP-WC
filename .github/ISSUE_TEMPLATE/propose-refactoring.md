**Target code area or entity**
This can cover a single entity (function, method or class) or an entity workflow than can be improved upon. 

**Target aspect**
For instance: some performance improvement, code readability, reduce repetition, better validation or a more comprehensive algorithm. There really are no limits here.

**Proposed solution**
Describe either in plain English or simply provide a sample inline implementation.
